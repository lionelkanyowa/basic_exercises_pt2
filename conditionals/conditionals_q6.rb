#Q.5 What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts " I don't have a favorite number."
end

#A. My guess would be it would print "My favorite number is 7" since the number declared was 7.
# The if statement would execute to be true since number = 7 is truthy.
